### The Todo list - assignment test:

#### After get the confirmation from Mr. Trieu Le for the new design and new suggestions, TodoList have functions:
+ Create a new Todo
+ Update status for the Todo
+ Update content for the Todo
+ Delete the Todo
+ Change to Active for many/all Todos
+ Delete many/all Todos
+ Mark many/all Todos completed
+ Move a done Todo to Doing list
+ Save changes to localStorage, and load these once again after user refresh

#### Whith the improve UI:

+ Link UI: https://xd.adobe.com/view/c05d38c9-140d-4e1c-a3e8-e17fa4d2ffee-950e/ 
+ For the action to edit a task, I suggest using one-click instead of double-click, because when users use the app without any instruction they don't know the double-click action.
+ If the list is too long, I will add pagination, which helps users prevent scrolling and focus.(NOT DONE YET)
+ I separate the done tasks below list to help users focus on their doing tasks. These once can be returned to the doing list if users click on the select box.
+ While users are editing the task but click outsides show modal to ask saving confirmation.
