### (1) what you were able to accomplish:
- For front-end engineer, you can use localStorage instead of calling remote APIs.
- We provided a simple UI for todo app, please enhance it with your creative mind.
- Please help us to add some features to the application:
    - The persistent feature. After refreshing, our todos will be disappeared, that's annoying for our users, let's use localStorage (or API calls for fullstack engineer) to keep them.
    - The edit feature. Currently, users cannot edit the todos, please help them (user double-clicks the todo to edit, presses enter to apply the changes, or clicks outside to discard).
    - The active/complete todo feature. Allows users to click on checkbox items they have completed

### (2) how to run your tests:
`npm test`

(3) things that you would like to add if given more time:
- create more unit testing
