### Requirements

#### Common (required for both positions)

- Write some tests to persuade us that what you had ADDED or FIXED are correct (choose your desired lib/framework).

#### Front-end engineer
- For front-end engineer, you can use localStorage instead of calling remote APIs.
- We provided a simple UI for todo app, please enhance it with your creative mind.
- Please help us to add some features to the application:
    - The persistent feature. After refreshing, our todos will be disappeared, that's annoying for our users, let's use localStorage (or API calls for fullstack engineer) to keep them.
    - The edit feature. Currently, users cannot edit the todos, please help them (user double-clicks the todo to edit, presses enter to apply the changes, or clicks outside to discard).

#### Fullstack engineer
