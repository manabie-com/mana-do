## INTRODUCTON

*To whom it may concern!*\
*Thank you for giving me a change to do this interesting coding challenge.*

Let me have a brief introduction about myself.\
My name is Thien Nguyen, 28 years old. I am currently working as a front-end web developer at HPT Vietnam Corporation. I graduated from the University of Science VNU-HCMC in Oct 2020 with a bachelor degree in IT. I am living and working in Thu Duc City, HCMC.


## COMMENTS ON THE CHALLENGE
I have found some bugs in the challenge
- Components are often basic html elements and they are not reusable. 
- The Router only have two fixed initial path ('/' and '/todo'), I have added a default route to redirect user to the front page.
- The original code does not have an authentication system, user cannot register, token are fixed. I have added the register page.
- I move the main page such as TodoPage, SigninPages,... to src/pages for better source code management. 
- I have to extend the IAPI interface to get more services that I have added.
- Added alert message to inform the user when there is error after request.
- I used local storage for storing users, todos, token. If the token remains available in the local storage, the user are still logged-in and can see his/her to-do list even the page is refreshed.
- Now, user can edit their own todo item.
- Improve the UI/UX.
- Components are reuseable, common control components are placed in ./commons and the other comoponents are placed in ./components.

## NOTES
- No package is installed, I just use the original source code and continue development.
- No use of CSS framework, everything is manually styled.
